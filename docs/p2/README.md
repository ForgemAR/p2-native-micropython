### Welcome to team-oz's Native MicroPython Documentation

After 18 months of playing with MicroPython on the Propeller 2, its time to share.   

As per other MicroPython ports there is a Quick Reference, Getting started tutorial, and general hardware reference. 

Further information about the Propeller 2 is being published late in 2020, find out more at https://www.Parallax.com
